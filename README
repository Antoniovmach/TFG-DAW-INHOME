Developed a web application for renting or exchanging properties, where users can log in, register, and browse general
property listings with filtering options such as start and end dates, province, locality, and category. Users can view
individual properties, book based on availability or exchange, and create listings with availability details. The
application includes a virtual currency system for transactions, allowing users to pay for bookings or exchanges.
Additionally, users can view their reservations, manage their properties, and accept or deny bookings and exchanges. A
Premium version is available for purchase, and the admin mode allows for the editing, viewing, and deletion of various
entities, including categories, property availability, localities, and more.
